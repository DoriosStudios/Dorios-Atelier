        - DropParticle — particle spawn definitions
        - DropResult — resolved drop payload (drops + side effects)
        - DropSound — sound definitions for base/override
        - ExtraDropEntry — bonus drops with chance/fortune scaling
        - FortuneMath / FortuneTier — fortune scaling rules and tier tables

- Added DoriosAPI container compatibility helpers (addItem/addItemAt/transferItems/transferItemsAt/transferItemsBetween/getContainerAt/getAllowedInputRange/getAllowedOutputRange/getMachineBlockedSlots/insertIntoInventory)
- Added DoriosAPI utility and math helpers (formatTimeFull, formatTime, capitalizeFirst, waitTicks/waitSeconds, formatIdToText, printJSON, scaleToSetNumber, roman conversions, distanceBetween)
